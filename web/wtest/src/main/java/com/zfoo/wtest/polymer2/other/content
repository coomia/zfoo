Custom elements.
Registering an element associates a class with a custom element name.
The element provides callbacks to manage its lifecycle. Polymer also lets you declare properties, to integrate your element's property API with the Polymer data system.


Shadow DOM.
Shadow DOM provides a local, encapsulated DOM tree for your element. Polymer can automatically create and populate a shadow tree for your element from a DOM template.


Events.
Polymer provides a declarative syntax for attaching event listeners to shadow DOM children. It also provides an optional library for handling gesture events.


Data system.
The Polymer data system provides data binding to properties and attributes; property observers; and computed properties.
